In order to use UMA Backpacks assets they must be added to the UMA global library. 
To do this open the global library window and drag the UMA Backpacks Sample folder onto the box inside the UMA Global Library window labled "Drag Indexable Assets here. Non indexed assets will be ignored." 
Once this is done you should be able to apply the backpack receipes to UMAs of the race:

The _M backpack receipe should apply to:
HumanMale
HumanMaleDCS

The _F backpack receipe should apply to:
HumanFemale
HumanFemaleDCS
